I'm Naveen kumar.k and I'have 3.9 years experience as Python Developer with Django and Django REST. I worked mainly with
Data structures, OOPs, Decorators, Regular Expressions, File Handling and Exception Handling.

Coming to my recent project Software Defined Storage Micro-services which is basically a disaster data recovery have
many policies. In this project we have Orchestration layer APIs between real user and NetAPP storage.

This project was developed in Python 2.7 with Django REST.
In this project, REST API mainly accept minimum attributes from user and call API of SDSMS which we expose outside to the
real user and it will call our internally Apache Airflow task Manager.
Apache Airflow is a task manager connected by RabbitMQ which is advanced messaging queue system.
My contribution in this project was developing REST API for NFS file system creation and authentication SSO using OAuth2,
written test suite using py-test, bug fixing and Migration of source code from python2to3.
This project about complete last of March.........

Coming to my Second project, US Garage Doors which was a web Application. It was manufacture of both Building and Plastic
products. This project was mainly a dealer specific application where dealer can login and give all specification of the
Garage doors which type, Width, .... around 20 - 30 fields and add to cart. This order can be taken from nearest plant.
My contribution on that project was creating an APIs and write db queries to get recent configurations which were fit.
The main propose of this project to check the flow of order from application to till order got shifted.
Developing API for (login), written docker file for database service, written test case using py-test and bug fixing.
Involved in Developing Customer dashboard to handle queries.
.......
..........
My first project was Auto Knowledge, it was also a web Application, it gives about Auto World like all new cars, its
releases and test drives.This website rates car on its performance and test drive. This was in three languages English,
Dutch, French. User can post the information about car he want to sell. We give control panel to admin of the website and

##########  What is Micro-services ? ############

Micro-service:
=============
It is a way to breaking your big single application into two or more Standalone and Independent applications that can
be Run on different hardware or server instances. They can communicate each other over a REST API and works together to
get functionality of an application or a product.

Each Micro-service goes separately in testing and deployed separately
Each Micro-service works separately and work together as part of user concern
If any Micro-service had issues, then that will not affect other one.
Advantages:
----------
1. Deployment flexibility (which all goes separately)
2. Technology flexibility (we can write all in different languages, but they communicate through REST APIs)
3. Can be scaled up/down separately 
Disadvantage:
-------------
1. Deployment / architecture complexity(if 100 of micro-services)
2. Service discoverability (which goes to consume)

Finally Monolithic architecture and Micro-service architecture has their own advantages and Disadvantages
