I'm Naveen kumar.K and I've 5.9 years IT experience. Around 5 years I've worked as Python Developer with Django and
Django REST.I've worked mainly with Data structures,Comprehension,OOPs,Decorators,Regular Expressions,File Handling and
Exception Handling in python. In AWS, I've worked on EC2, AWS cloudwatch and IAM. Knowledge of Lambda, S3.

Coming to my recent project, ReAmped Energy is an independent electricity provider operating in Australia. It was
designed in Python, Flask, Odoo Framework, RabbitMQ and Zato.
We are provided API's to client and CX which can be handled with Flask and Python, and backend functionality was handled 
with Odoo framework, RabbitMQ and Zato. Complete project we are hosting in AWS and every day we analyize the live
logs with AWS could Watch and have a required action for those error if any.

This project was developed in OpenERP7 and python 2.7 and 
I have worked invoice steps processing, some crons (DNC and DBS) cron implementing.
Participated in API development on Language choice and Account details. 
Migrate the code base to Python 3.6 and Odoo 13. 
Worked on Sanitization scripts and SQL scripts implementing.

Coming to my third project, Software Defined Storage Micro-services which is basically a disaster data recovery 
have many policies. In this project we have Orchestration layer APIs between real user and NetAPP storage.

This project was developed in Python 2.7 with Django REST.
In this project, REST API mainly accept minimum attributes from user and call API of SDSMS which we expose outside 
to the real user and it will call our internally Apache Airflow task Manager.
Apache Airflow is a task manager connected by RabbitMQ which is advanced messaging queue system.
My contribution in this project was developing REST API for NFS file system creation and authentication 
SSO using OAuth2, written test suite using py-test, bug fixing and Migration of source code from python2to3.

Coming to my Second project, US Garage Doors which is a web Application. It is a manufacture of both Plastic/wooden 
products and Building. This project was mainly a dealer specific application where dealer can login and give all 
specification of the Garage doors which type, Width, .... around 20 - 30 fields and add to cart. This order can be 
taken from nearest plant. My contribution on that project was creating an APIs and write db queries to get recent 
configurations which were fit. The main propose of this project to check the flow of order from application to till 
order got shifted. Developing API for (login), written docker file for database service, written test case using 
py-test and bug fixing. Involved in Developing Customer dashboard to handle queries.
.......
..........
My first project was Auto Knowledge, it is also a web Application, it gives about Auto World like all new cars, 
its releases and test drives.This website rates car on its performance and test drive. This was in three languages 
English, Dutch, French. User can post the information about car he want to sell. We give control panel to admin of 
the website and they will monitor.Coming to my contribution, creation an API for car module, developing 
authentication and authorization using  JWT Libs. writing DB queries to retrieving data and written test cases 
using py-test.

##########  What is Micro-services ? ############

Micro-service:
=============
It is a way of breaking your big monolithic application into two or more Standalone and Independent applications 
that can be Run on different hardware or server instances. They can communicate each other over a REST API and 
works together to get functionality of an application or a product.

Each Micro-service goes separately in testing and deployed separately
Each Micro-service works separately or work together as part of user concern
If any Micro-service had issues, then that will not affect others.
Advantages:
----------
1. Deployment flexibility (which all goes separately)
2. Technology flexibility (we can write all in different languages, but they communicate through REST APIs)
3. Can be scaled up/down separately 
Disadvantage:
-------------
1. Deployment / architecture complexity(if 100 of micro-services)
2. Service discoverability (which goes to consume)

Finally Monolithic architecture and Micro-service architecture has their own advantages and Disadvantages

Orchestration layer in Microservice:
------------------------------------
Orchestration is the traditional way of handling interactions between different services in Service-Oriented 
Architecture (SOA). ... For example, if three services needed to be called in a particular order, the orchestrator 
makes a call to each one, waiting for a response before calling the next.

Zato:
----
Zato is an open source Python-based middleware platform and backend application server. 
It was designed as an agile ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) aimed at building systems of systems 
either on-premise or in the cloud. Zato provides SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), 
REST (Representational State Transfer), APIs and cloud integration, as well as back-end services 
exposure to front-end clients.
Zato is a powerful and scalable platform that not only assists in building and orchestrating integration services, but 
also enhances intercommunication across applications and data sources. It can keep in order all technical solutions your
business uses and open way for new opportunities and processes. Usage of a wide range of connectors, data formats and 
protocols allows Zato to avoid restricting architectural style or enforcing any other limitations.
