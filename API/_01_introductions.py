API:
---
Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each
other without any user intervention. API is a collection of software functions and procedures. In simple terms,
API means a software code that can be accessed or executed. API is defined as a code that helps two different
software’s to communicate and exchange data with each other.

It offers products or services to communicate with other products and services without having to know how they’re
implemented.

Example of API:

Let see how API works using simple daily life example. Imagine that you went to a restaurant to take lunch or dinner.
The waiter comes to you gives you a menu card, and you will provide personalize it order like you want a veg sandwich
but without onion.
After some time, you will get your order from the waiter. However, it is not that simple as it looks as there is some
process that happens in between.
Here, the waiter plays an important part as you will neither go to the kitchen to collect your order nor will you
tell the kitchen staff what you want all this done by the waiter.

API also does the same by taking your request, and just like the waiter tell the system what you want and give a
response back to you.

API Example 2:
===============
After understanding the concept, let us take some more technical examples.
For example, you go to the movie site, you enter your movie, name, and credit card information, and behold,
you print out tickets.
They are collaborating with other applications. This integration is called “seamless,” as you never have a clue when
a software role is passed from one application to another.
