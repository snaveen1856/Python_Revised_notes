KEY DIFFERENCE
Web service is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data
between systems or applications whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications
to interact with each other without any user involvement.
Web service is used for REST, SOAP and XML-RPC for communication while API is used for any style
of communication.
Web service supports only HTTP protocol whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Web service supports XML while API supports XML and JSON.
All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not web services.
