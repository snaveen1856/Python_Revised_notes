what is a docker?

Docker is a container management service, which mean develop, ship it and run anywhere.
The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers
which can then be deployed anywhere.

Features of Docker:
==================
1. Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the
operating system via containers.
2. With containers, it becomes easier for teams across different units, such as development, QA and
Operations to work seamlessly across applications.
3. You can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machines and even on the cloud.
Since Docker containers are pretty lightweight, they are very easily scalable.


commonly use commands:
======================
docker â€“version
docker pull
docker run
docker ps
docker ps -a
docker exec
docker stop
docker kill
docker commit
docker login
docker push
docker images
docker rm
