Python RegEx:
============
A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

RegEx Module
Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

Import the re module:
=====================
import re
RegEx in Python
When you have imported the re module, you can start using regular expressions:

Example:
-------
Search the string to see if it starts with "The" and ends with "Spain":

import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)
RegEx Functions
The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:

Function:	        Description:
====================================
findall ====> Returns a list containing all matches
finditer ===> Returns a iterable object
search =====> Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
match ======> Returns a Match object if there is a match at only beginning of string
split ======> Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
sub	========> Replaces one or many matches with a string

Metacharacters:
---------------
Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

Character	Description	Example	Try it
---------------------------------------
[]	A set of characters	"[a-m]"
\	Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters) "\d"
.	Any character (except newline character)	"he..o"
^	Starts with	"^hello"
$	Ends with	"world$"
*	Zero or more occurrences	"aix*"
+	One or more occurrences	"aix+"
{}	Exactly the specified number of occurrences	"al{2}"
|	Either or	"falls|stays"
()	Capture and group

Special Sequences:
-----------------
A special sequence is a '\' followed by one of the characters in the list below, and has a special meaning:

Character	Description	Example	Try it:
--------------------------------------
'\A' Returns a match if the specified characters are at the beginning of the string	"\AThe"
\b	Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word	r"\bain"
r"ain\b"
\B	Returns a match where the specified characters are present, but NOT at the beginning (or at the end)
of a word	r"\Bain"
   r"ain\B"
\d	Returns a match where the string contains digits (numbers from 0-9)	"\d"
\D	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain digits	"\D"
\s	Returns a match where the string contains a white space character	"\s"
\S	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain a white space character	"\S"
\w	Returns a match where the string contains any word characters (characters from a to Z, digits from 0-9,
  and the underscore _ character)	"\w"
\W	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain any word characters	"\W"
\Z	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the end of the string	"Spain\Z"
Sets:
=====
A set is a set of characters inside a pair of square brackets [] with a special meaning:

Set	Description	Try it:
-----------------------
[arn]	Returns a match where one of the specified characters (a, r, or n) are present
[a-n]	Returns a match for any lower case character, alphabetically between a and n
[^arn]	Returns a match for any character EXCEPT a, r, and n
[0123]	Returns a match where any of the specified digits (0, 1, 2, or 3) are present
[0-9]	Returns a match for any digit between 0 and 9
[0-5][0-9]	Returns a match for any two-digit numbers from 00 and 59
[a-zA-Z]	Returns a match for any character alphabetically between a and z, lower case OR upper case
[+]	In sets, +, *, ., |, (), $,{} has no special meaning, so [+] means: return a match for any + character in the string

The findall() Function:
=======================
The findall() function returns a list containing all matches.

Example:
---------
Print a list of all matches:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.findall("ai", str)
print(x)
The list contains the matches in the order they are found.
If no matches are found, an empty list is returned:

Example:
-------
Return an empty list if no match was found:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.findall("Portugal", str)
print(x)

The search() Function:
=====================
The search() function searches the string for a match, and returns a Match object if there is a match.

If there is more than one match, only the first occurrence of the match will be returned:

Example:
-------
Search for the first white-space character in the string:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("\s", str)

print("The first white-space character is located in position:", x.start())
If no matches are found, the value None is returned:

Example:
--------
Make a search that returns no match:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("Portugal", str)
print(x)

The split() Function
The split() function returns a list where the string has been split at each match:

Example
-------
Split at each white-space character:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.split("\s", str)
print(x)
You can control the number of occurrences by specifying the maxsplit parameter:

Example
-------
Split the string only at the first occurrence:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.split("\s", str, 1)
print(x)

The sub() Function
The sub() function replaces the matches with the text of your choice:

Example
-------
Replace every white-space character with the number 9:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.sub("\s", "9", str)
print(x)
You can control the number of replacements by specifying the count parameter:

Example
-------
Replace the first 2 occurrences:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.sub("\s", "9", str, 2)
print(x)

Match Object
A Match Object is an object containing information about the search and the result.

Note: If there is no match, the value None will be returned, instead of the Match Object.

Example
-------
Do a search that will return a Match Object:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("ai", str)
print(x) #this will print an object
The Match object has properties and methods used to retrieve information about the search, and the result:

.span() returns a tuple containing the start-, and end positions of the match.
.string returns the string passed into the function
.group() returns the part of the string where there was a match

Example
------
Print the position (start- and end-position) of the first match occurrence.

The regular expression looks for any words that starts with an upper case "S":

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search(r"\bS\w+", str)
print(x.span())
Example
Print the string passed into the function:

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search(r"\bS\w+", str)
print(x.string)
Example
-------
Print the part of the string where there was a match.

The regular expression looks for any words that starts with an upper case "S":

import re

str = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search(r"\bS\w+", str)
print(x.group())
Note: If there is no match, the value None will be returned, instead of the Match Object.
