Data Structure(DS):



Types of DS:
------------
Built-in DS                                             User Defined DS
-----------                                             ---------------
1. List                                                 1. Array
2. Tuple                                                2. Stack
3. Dictionary                                           3. Queue
4. Set                                                  4. Linked List
                                                        5. Tree 
                                                        6. Graph
                                                        7. Hash map

USER DEFIND DS:
---------------
1. Array:
---------
# it stores multiple values of the same type of items. 
# technically arrays in python are distinct from both Numpy Arrays and python list.  
# It is Linear Data structure. 
types of Arrays: One dimensional and Two dimensional 

2. Stack:
---------
# it follows LIFO (Last In First Out)
# new item is added at one end and remove at that end only.  
# insert an item is called Push and delete operation is called as Pop.   
# Time complexity is O(1) [BIBO]
# it is a Linear data structure.       

3. Queue:
---------
# it follows FIFO (First In First Out)
# insertion of items called Rear (enqueue)
# deleting of items called Front (Dequeue)
# Time complexity O(1) [BIBO]
# it is a Linear Data structure

4. Linked List:
---------------
A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. 
Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. 
Python does not have linked lists in its standard library. We implement the concept of linked lists 
using the concept of nodes.  

# it is a Linear Data structure
